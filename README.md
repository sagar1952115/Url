# Url Shortner

This is a simple URL shortener application that generates short, 5-character URLs using the Base64 encoding method. By default, each shortened URL expires automatically after 10 days. However, authenticated users can create URLs with a lifespan of up to 1 year. The application also includes backend analytics to track URL usage, but as this is the first phase, there is no authentication system or dashboard to display statistics yet. Future updates will include these features.

## Environment Configuration

This project requires two `.env` files: one for the **client** and one for the **server**. Each environment has specific configuration settings.

### Setting Up `.env` for Server

1. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Create a .env file in the server directory and add the necessary environment variables.

Example .env for the server:

```bash
SENTRY_DSN="your-sentry-url"
NODE_ENV="development"
PORT=5000
REDIS_PASSWORD="your-redis-password"
BASE_URL="http://localhost:5000"
```

### Setting Up `.env` for Client

1. Navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Create a .env file in the server directory and add the necessary environment variables.

Example .env for the client:

```bash
VITE_BASE_URL="your-server-base-url"
```

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

### Notes

- For local development, ensure the server and client `.env` files are configured with the correct URLs, ports, and any other environment-specific settings.
- You may need to restart both the server and client after modifying `.env` files to apply the new settings.
